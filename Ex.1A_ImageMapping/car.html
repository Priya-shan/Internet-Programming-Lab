<p>A car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for
transportation.<br> Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight
people, <br>have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.<br> Cars came into
global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them</p>
